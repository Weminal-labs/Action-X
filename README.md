When using decentralized applications (dApps), users often have to repeat the process of connecting and performing similar actions multiple times. We asked ourselves: "Can these actions be unified on a single web page?" From that question, we developed Action X - a solution that simplifies and unifies the user experience when interacting with dApps. 

    Must open another tab to interact with another dapp 

    Must re-connect to wallet 

    Repeat to many actions that aren't necessary

## Overview
Enable ActionX on Twitter, with wallet support by APTOS

ActionX is the behind-the-scenes engine for Aptos blockchain transactions on websites and apps. A clickable link that makes those actions easier to use, like a shortcut button.

ActionX make it simple for developers to integrate the things you can do throughout the Aptos ecosystem right into your environment, allowing you to perform blockchain transactions without needing to navigate away to a different app or webpage.

The ActionX project built by Weminal Labs. The group of developers looking to simplify and enhance interactions with the aptos blockchain. We develop a SDK/APIs that allow transactions to be  previewed, signed, and sent across various contexts without the need for a third-party application.
